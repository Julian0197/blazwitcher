# Overview
[‰∏≠Êñá README](./docs/README_zh.md)

Blazwitcher is a local [Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/blazwitcher-search-and-sw/fjgablnemienkegdnbihhemebmmonihg?hl=en-US) for searching tabs, bookmarks, and history, with support for fuzzy **Pinyin** search. It is also the perfect solution for those who work with multiple tabs open and want to switch the correct tab or create a new tab from history or bookmarks quickly without the hassle of manually operation.

## Features
- Fuzzy Pinyin Search: Supports Chinese and English mixed fuzzy search, pinyin is supported by default which's very kind for Chinese(rely on [text-search-engine](https://github.com/cjinhuo/text-search-engine)).
- Intuitive Ordering: The search results are descended by the weight value returned by the [text-search-engine](https://github.com/cjinhuo/text-search-engine) and the last time it was used, allowing you to locate your target faster.
- Tab Search: Search across all Chrome tabs you opened
- History Search: Search the last 200 history item
- Bookmark Search: Search across all your bookmarks
- Switch and create tab rapidly: Just key down 'enter' to switch or open the tab you want rapidly
